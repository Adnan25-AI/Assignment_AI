India's revocation of Article 370 in 2019, which changed the status of Jammu and Kashmir, has been a major point of contention. Pakistan strongly condemns India's actions and demands a resolution according to UN resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.\n",
            "*   **Cross-Border Terrorism:** India accuses Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, while Pakistan denies these charges and insists it only provides moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.\n",

            "*   **Diplomatic Relations:** Diplomatic relations are strained. High Commissioners have been withdrawn, and visa restrictions remain in place.\n",
            "*   **Trade:** Trade between the two countries is minimal.\n",
            "*   **Kulbhushan Jadhav Case:** The case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian national sentenced to death in Pakistan on espionage charges, remains a point of contention. India maintains he was wrongly accused.\n",

            "**Recent Developments and Potential for Improvement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Ceasefire Agreement:** The Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of both countries agreed to a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in February 2021, which has generally held.\n",
            "*   **Kartarpur Corridor:** The Kartarpur Corridor, which allows Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit a holy shrine in Pakistan without a visa, is a positive development.\n",
            "*   **Back-Channel Diplomacy:** There have been reports of back-channel diplomatic efforts to ease tensions.\n",

The resolution of the Kashmir issue, addressing concerns about terrorism, and building trust are crucial for achieving lasting peace and stability in the region.\n"
